Simple project using a few types of modules (built-in, user defined and from out of the box) that represents a students center:

ENDPOINTS

GET http://localhost:3000/students

POST http://localhost:3000/students

GET http://localhost:3000/students/courses

GET http://localhost:3000/courses

and will add more later

Built-In modules use:

http


NPM installed modules:

mysql
body


Also the app is distributed into modules to achieve modularity and clean code, in addition to maintnability. We also module object along their export property to achieve this.
